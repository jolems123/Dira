# Dira launch gap tracker

Status is evidence-based: OPEN, IN PROGRESS, FIXED (verified), BLOCKED. Never call an untested change FIXED.

| Tenant security | Complete buyer and supplier route isolation not proven | Critical | apps/api/src/routes/* | Endpoint-by-endpoint scoped authorization | cross-tenant tests | OPEN |
| Segregation of duties | Request and PO self-approval; invoice match gate | Critical | apps/api/src/routes/procurement.ts | Self-approval blocked; further limits/PO threshold/override remain | self-approval tests added; CI pending | IN PROGRESS |

Final plan prices; tax rules per country beyond reviewed profiles; live fiscal API integrations; sandbox/live merchant accounts; accounting credentials; Railway environment; private S3 bucket; email domain; legal review; any exposed or previously used secrets to rotate.

## Branches
- jolems123-patch-1: zero commits ahead of main, 10 behind; ancestor by compare API; deletion pending unsupported connector action.
- uganda-currency: identical to main; deletion pending unsupported connector action.
- fix/dira-security: working branch. Never merge to main automatically.

## 2026-11-08 security work log
- `fix/dira-security`: positioning and tracker created; production environment validator; source-code database fallback sanitized (old history still contains a password-like value); JWT issuer/audience/algorithm enforcement; refresh credential compare-and-swap and replay revocation; self-approval request gate; opt-in dev seed with hard production refusal; PR CI workflow. **Do not mark verified until CI completes successfully**.
- Refresh sessions presently have no durable per-device session-family identifier; replay handling revokes all user refresh credentials. Stronger per-session isolation is future work.
- Required auth cross-tenant/route tests, PO approval-limit rules, uploads and scan evidence remain unverified.
